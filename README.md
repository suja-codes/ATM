### Description 

- Simulation of an ATM based on the following principles:

- Input validation

    - It works by saving state after each submit click and recalculating the balance of the account.
  
    - As a result, Cash backs bigger than balance are not allowed.
  
    - Account balance can't go negative since withdrawals more than what's actually available in the account is not permitted.

  
-  Conditional rendering for the number input and submit fields. 

    - This means that they will not even show on the page before the user has selected an action (Deposit or Cash Back).
  
    - This avoids confusion for the user and keeps UI neat.
